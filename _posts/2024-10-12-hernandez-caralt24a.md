title: Joint Diffusion Processes as an Inductive Bias in Sheaf Neural Networks
abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally extend Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  by endowing a cellular sheaf over the graph, equipping nodes and edges with vector
  spaces and defining linear mappings between them. While the attached geometric structure
  has proven to be useful in analyzing heterophily and oversmoothing, so far the methods
  by which the sheaf is computed do not always guarantee a good performance in such
  settings. In this work, drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics concepts, we propose
  two novel sheaf learning approaches that (i) provide a more intuitive understanding
  of the involved structure maps, (ii) introduce a useful inductive bias for heterophily
  and oversmoothing, and (iii) infer the sheaf in a way that does not scale with the
  number of features, thus using fewer learnable parameters than existing methods.
  In our evaluation, we show the limitations of the real-world benchmarks used so
  far on SNNs, and design a new synthetic task –leveraging the symmetries of $n$-dimensional
  ellipsoids– that enables us to better assess the strengths and weaknesses of sheaf-based
  models.  Our extensive experimentation on these novel datasets reveals valuable
  insights into the scenarios and contexts where basic SNNs and our proposed approaches
  can be beneficial.
