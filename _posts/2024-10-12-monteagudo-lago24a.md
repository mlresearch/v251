title: Asynchrony Invariance Loss Functions for Graph Neural Networks
abstract: A ubiquitous class of graph neural networks (GNNs) operates according to
  the message-passing paradigm, such that nodes systematically broadcast and listen
  to their neighbourhood. Yet, these synchronous computations have been deemed potentially
  sub-optimal as they could result in irrelevant information sent across the graph,
  thus interfering with efficient representation learning. In this work, we devise
  self-supervised loss functions biasing learning of synchronous GNN-based neural
  algorithmic reasoners towards representations that are invariant to asynchronous
  execution. Asynchrony invariance could successfully be learned, as revealed by analyses
  exploring the evolution of the self-supervised losses as well as their effect on
  the learned latent embeddings. Our approach to enforce asynchrony invariance constitutes
  a novel, potentially valuable tool for graph representation learning, which is increasingly
  prevalent in multiple real-world contexts.
