title: 'The Geometry of Diffusion Models: Tubular Neighbourhoods and Singularities'
abstract: Diffusion generative models have been a leading approach for generating
  high-dimensional data. The current research aims to investigate the relation between
  the dynamics of diffusion models and the tubular neighbourhoods of a data manifold.
  We propose an algorithm to estimate the injectivity radius, the supremum of radii
  of tubular neighbourhoods. Our research relates geometric objects such as curvatures
  of data manifolds and dimensions of ambient spaces, to singularities of the generative
  dynamics such as emergent critical phenomena or spontaneous symmetry breaking.
