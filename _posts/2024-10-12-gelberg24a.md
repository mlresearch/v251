title: 'Variational Inference Failures Under Model Symmetries: Permutation Invariant
  Posteriors for Bayesian Neural Networks'
abstract: Weight space symmetries in neural network architectures, such as permutation
  symmetries in MLPs, give rise to Bayesian neural network (BNN) posteriors with many
  equivalent modes. This multimodality poses a challenge for variational inference
  (VI) techniques, which typically rely on approximating the posterior with a unimodal
  distribution. In this work, we investigate the impact of weight space permutation
  symmetries on VI. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that these
  symmetries lead to biases in the approximate posterior, which degrade predictive
  performance and posterior fit if not explicitly accounted for. To mitigate this
  behavior, we leverage the symmetric structure of the posterior and devise a symmetrization
  mechanism for constructing permutation invariant variational posteriors. We show
  that the symmetrized distribution has a strictly better fit to the true posterior,
  and that it can be trained using the original ELBO objective with a modified KL
  regularization term. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach mitigates the
  aforementioned biases and results in improved predictions and a higher ELBO.
