title: A Simple and Expressive Graph Neural Network Based Method for Structural Link
  Representation
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks
  like node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. While much
  research has focused on their ability to distinguish graphs, fewer studies have
  addressed their capacity to differentiate links, a complex and less explored area.
  This paper introduces SLRGNN, a novel, theoretically grounded GNN-based method for
  link prediction. SLRGNN ensures that link representations are distinct if and only
  if the links have different structural roles within the graph. Our approach transforms
  the link prediction problem into a node classification problem on the corresponding
  line graph, enhancing expressiveness without sacrificing efficiency. Unlike existing
  methods, SLRGNN computes link probabilities in a single inference step, avoiding
  the need for individual subgraph constructions. We provide a formal proof of our
  methodâ€™s expressiveness and validate its superior performance through experiments
  on real-world datasets. The code is publicly available1
