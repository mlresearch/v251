title: 'Equivariant vs. Invariant Layers: A Comparison of Backbone and Pooling for
  Point Cloud Classification'
abstract: 'Learning from set-structured data, such as point clouds, has gained significant
  attention from the machine learning community. Geometric deep learning provides
  a blueprint for designing effective set neural networks that preserve the permutation
  symmetry of set-structured data. Of our interest are permutation invariant networks,
  which are composed of a permutation equivariant backbone, permutation invariant
  global pooling, and regression/classification head. While existing literature has
  focused on improving equivariant backbones, the impact of the pooling layer is often
  overlooked. In this paper, we examine the interplay between permutation equivariant
  backbones and permutation invariant global pooling on three benchmark point cloud
  classification datasets. Our findings reveal that: 1) complex pooling methods, such
  as transport-based or attention-based poolings, can significantly boost the performance
  of simple backbones, but the benefits diminish for more complex backbones, 2) even
  complex backbones can benefit from pooling layers in low data scenarios, 3) surprisingly,
  the choice of pooling layers can have a more significant impact on the modelâ€™s performance
  than adjusting the width and depth of the backbone, and 4) pairwise combination
  of pooling layers can significantly improve the performance of a fixed backbone.
  Our comprehensive study provides insights for practitioners to design better permutation
  invariant set neural networks. Our code is available at https://github.com/mint-vu/backbone_vs_pooling.'
