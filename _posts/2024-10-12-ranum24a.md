title: 'The NGT200 Dataset: Geometric Multi-View Isolated Sign Recognition'
abstract: Sign Language Processing (SLP) provides a foundation for a more inclusive
  future in language technology; however, the field faces several significant challenges
  that must be addressed to achieve practical, real-world applications. This work
  addresses multi-view isolated sign recognition (MV-ISR), and highlights the essential
  role of 3D awareness and geometry in SLP systems.  We introduce the NGT200 dataset,
  a novel spatio-temporal multi-view benchmark, establishing MV-ISR as distinct from
  single-view ISR (SV-ISR). We demonstrate the benefits of synthetic data and propose
  conditioning sign representations on spatial symmetries inherent in sign language.
  Leveraging an SE(2) equivariant model improves MV-ISR performance by 8-22 percent  over
  the baseline.
