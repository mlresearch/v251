title: Metric Learning for Clifford Group Equivariant Neural Networks
abstract: Clifford Group Equivariant Neural Networks (CGENNs) leverage Clifford algebras
  and multivectors as an alternative approach to incorporating group equivariance
  to ensure symmetry constraints in neural representations. In principle, this formulation
  generalizes to orthogonal groups and preserves equivariance regardless of the metric
  signature. However, previous works have restricted internal network representations
  to Euclidean or Minkowski (pseudo-)metrics, handpicked depending on the problem
  at hand. In this work, we propose an alternative method that enables the metric
  to be learned in a data-driven fashion, allowing the CGENN network to learn more
  flexible representations. Specifically, we populate metric matrices fully, ensuring
  they are symmetric by construction, and leverage eigenvalue decomposition to integrate
  this additional learnable component into the original CGENN formulation in a principled
  manner. Additionally, we motivate our method using insights from category theory,
  which enables us to explain Clifford algebras as a categorical construction and
  guarantee the mathematical soundness of our approach. We validate our method in
  various tasks and showcase the advantages of learning more flexible latent metric
  representations. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/rick-ali/Metric-Learning-for-CGENNs}.
