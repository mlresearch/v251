title: Topological and Dynamical Representations for Radio Frequency Signal Classification
abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) signals are found throughout our world, carrying over-the-air
  information for both digital and analog uses with applications ranging from WiFi
  to the radio. One area of focus in RF signal analysis is determining the modulation
  schemes employed in these signals which is crucial in many RF signal processing
  domains from secure communication to spectrum monitoring. This work investigates
  the accuracy and noise robustness of novel Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and dynamic
  representation based approaches paired with a small convolution neural network for
  RF signal modulation classification with a comparison to state-of-the-art deep neural
  network approaches. We show that using TDA tools, like Vietoris-Rips and lower star
  filtration, and the Takens’ embedding in conjunction with a standard shallow neural
  network we can capture the intrinsic dynamical, geometric, and topological features
  of the underlying signal’s manifold, informative representations of the RF signals.
  Our approach is effective in handling the modulation classification task and is
  notably noise robust, outperforming the commonly used deep neural network approaches
  in mode classification. Moreover, our fusion of dynamical and topological information
  is able to attain similar performance to deep neural network architectures with
  significantly smaller training datasets.
