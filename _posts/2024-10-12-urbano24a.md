title: Self-supervised detection of perfect and partial input-dependent symmetries
abstract: Group equivariance can overly constrain models if the symmetries in the
  group differ from those observed in data. While common methods address this by determining
  the appropriate level of symmetry at the dataset level, they are limited to supervised
  settings and ignore scenarios in which multiple levels of symmetry co-exist in the
  same dataset. In this paper, we propose a method able to detect the level of symmetry
  of each input without the need for labels. Our framework is general enough to accommodate
  different families of both continuous and discrete symmetry distributions, such
  as arbitrary unimodal, symmetric distributions and discrete groups. We validate
  the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic datasets with different per-class
  levels of symmetries, and demonstrate practical applications such as the detection
  of out-of-distribution symmetries.
