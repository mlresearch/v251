title: 3D Shape Completion with Test-Time Training
abstract: This work addresses the problem of <em> shape completion</em>, i.e., the
  task of restoring incomplete shapes by predicting their missing parts. While previous
  works have often predicted the fractured and restored shape in one step, we approach
  the task by separately predicting the fractured and newly restored parts, but ensuring
  these predictions are interconnected. We use a decoder network motivated by related
  work on the prediction of signed distance functions (DeepSDF). In particular, our
  representation allows us to consider <em> test-time-training</em>, i.e., finetuning
  network parameters to match the given incomplete shape more accurately during inference.
  While previous works often have difficulties with artifacts around the fracture
  boundary, we demonstrate that our overfitting to the fractured parts leads to significant
  improvements in the restoration of eight different shape categories of the ShapeNet
  data set in terms of their chamfer distances.
