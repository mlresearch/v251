title: Invertible Temper Modeling using Normalizing Flows and the Effects of Structure
  Preserving Loss
abstract: Advanced manufacturing research and development is typically small-scale,
  owing to costly experiments associated with these novel processes. Deep learning
  techniques could help accelerate this development cycle but frequently struggle
  in small-data regimes like the advanced manufacturing space. While prior work has
  applied deep learning to modeling visually plausible advanced manufacturing microstructures,
  little work has been done on data-driven modeling of how microstructures are affected
  by heat treatment, or assessing the degree to which synthetic microstructures are
  able to support existing workflows. We propose to address this gap by using invertible
  neural networks (normalizing flows) to model the effects of heat treatment, e.g.,
  tempering. The model is developed using scanning electron microscope imagery from
  samples produced using shear-assisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE) manufacturing.
  This approach not only produces visually and topologically plausible samples, but
  also captures information related to a sampleâ€™s material properties or experimental
  process parameters. We also demonstrate that topological data analysis, used in
  prior work to characterize microstructures, can also be used to stabilize model
  training, preserve structure, and improve downstream results. We assess directions
  for future work and identify our approach as an important step towards an end-to-end
  deep learning system for accelerating advanced manufacturing research and development.
