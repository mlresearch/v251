title: 'SCENE-Net V2: Interpretable Multiclass 3D Scene Understanding with Geometric
  Priors'
abstract: 'In this paper, we present SCENE-Net V2, a new resource-efficient, gray-box
  model for multiclass 3D scene understanding. SCENE-Net V2 leverages Group Equivariant
  Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) to incorporate fundamental geometric priors as
  inductive biases, offering a more transparent alternative to the prevalent black-box
  models in the domain. This model addresses the limitations of its white-box predecessor,
  SCENE-Net, by expanding its applicability from pole-like structures to a wider range
  of datasets with detailed 3D elements. Our model achieves the sweet-spot between
  application and transparency: SCENE-Net V2 is a general method for object identification
  with interpretability guarantees. Our experimental results demonstrate that SCENE-Net
  V2 achieves competitive performance with a significantly lower parameter count.
  Furthermore, we propose the use of GENEO-based architectures as a feature extraction
  tool for black-box models, enabling an increase in performance by adding a minimal
  number of meaningful parameters. Our code is available in: https://github.com/dlavado/SCENE-Net-V2.'
