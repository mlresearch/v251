title: 'Sheaf Diffusion Goes Nonlinear: Enhancing GNNs with Adaptive Sheaf Laplacians'
abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently been introduced to enhance Graph
  Neural Networks (GNNs) in their capability to learn from graphs. Previous studies
  either focus on linear sheaf Laplacians or hand-crafted nonlinear sheaf Laplacians.
  The former are not always expressive enough in modeling complex interactions between
  nodes, such as antagonistic dynamics and bounded confidence dynamics, while the
  latter use a fixed nonlinear function that is not adapted to the data at hand. To
  enhance the capability of SNNs to capture complex node-to-node interactions while
  adapting to different scenarios, we propose a Nonlinear Sheaf Diffusion (NLSD) model,
  which incorporates nonlinearity into the Laplacian of SNNs through a general function
  learned from data. Our model is validated on a synthetic community detection dataset,
  where it outperforms linear SNNs and common GNN baselines in a node classification
  task, showcasing its ability to leverage complex network dynamics.
