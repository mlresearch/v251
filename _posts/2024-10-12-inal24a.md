title: Adaptive Sampling for Continuous Group Equivariant Neural Networks
abstract: Steerable networks, which process data with intrinsic symmetries, often
  use Fourier-based non-linearities that require sampling from the entire group, leading
  to a need for discretization in continuous groups. As the number of samples increases,
  both performance and equivariance improve, yet this also leads to higher computational
  costs. To address this, we introduce an adaptive sampling approach that dynamically
  adjusts the sampling process to the symmetries in the data, reducing the number
  of required group samples and lowering the computational demands. We explore various
  implementations and their effects on model performance, equivariance, and computational
  efficiency. Our findings demonstrate improved model performance, and a marginal
  increase in memory efficiency
