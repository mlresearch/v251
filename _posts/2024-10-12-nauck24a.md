title: Dirac–Bianconi Graph Neural Networks – Enabling Non-Diffusive Long-Range Graph
  Predictions
abstract: The geometry of a graph is encoded in dynamical processes on the graph.
  Many graph neural network (GNN) architectures are inspired by such dynamical systems,
  typically based on the graph Laplacian. Here, we introduce Dirac–Bianconi GNNs (DBGNNs),
  which are based on the topological Dirac equation recently proposed by Bianconi.
  Based on the graph Laplacian, we demonstrate that DBGNNs explore the geometry of
  the graph in a fundamentally different way than conventional message passing neural
  networks (MPNNs). While regular MPNNs propagate features diffusively, analogous
  to the heat equation, DBGNNs allow for coherent long-range propagation. Experimental
  results showcase the superior performance of DBGNNs over existing conventional MPNNs
  for long-range predictions of power grid stability and peptide properties. This
  study highlights the effectiveness of DBGNNs in capturing intricate graph dynamics,
  providing notable advancements in GNN architectures.
