title: A Coding-Theoretic Analysis of Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning Geometry
abstract: 'Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to
  representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The
  prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and
  known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings:
  (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically
  sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper,
  we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation
  procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated
  prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally,
  we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable
  and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.'
