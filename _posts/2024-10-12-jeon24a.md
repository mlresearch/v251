title: Leveraging Topological Guidance for Improved Knowledge Distillation
abstract: Deep learning has shown its efficacy in extracting useful features to solve
  various computer vision tasks. However, when the structure of the data is complex
  and noisy, capturing effective information to improve performance is very difficult.
  To this end, topological data analysis (TDA) has been utilized to derive useful
  representations that can contribute to improving performance and robustness against
  perturbations. Despite its effectiveness, the requirements for large computational
  resources and significant time consumption in extracting topological features through
  TDA are critical problems when implementing it on small devices. To address this
  issue, we propose a framework called Topological Guidance-based Knowledge Distillation
  (TGD), which uses topological features in knowledge distillation (KD) for image
  classification tasks. We utilize KD to train a superior lightweight model and provide
  topological features with multiple teachers simultaneously. We introduce a mechanism
  for integrating features from different teachers and reducing the knowledge gap
  between teachers and the student, which aids in improving performance. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach through diverse empirical evaluations.
