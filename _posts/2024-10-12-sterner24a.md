title: Commute-Time-Optimised Graphs for GNNs
abstract: We explore graph rewiring methods that optimise commute time. Recent graph
  rewiring approaches facilitate long-range interactions in sparse graphs, making
  such rewirings commute-time-optimal on average. However, when an expert prior exists
  on which node pairs should or should not interact, a superior rewiring would favour
  short commute times between these privileged node pairs. We construct two synthetic
  datasets with known priors reflecting realistic settings, and use these to motivate
  two bespoke rewiring methods that incorporate the known prior. We investigate the
  regimes where our rewiring improves test performance on the synthetic datasets.
  Finally, we perform a case study on a real-world citation graph to investigate the
  practical implications of our work.
