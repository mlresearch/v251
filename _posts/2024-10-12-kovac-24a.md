title: E(n) Equivariant Message Passing Cellular Networks
abstract: 'This paper introduces E(n) Equivariant Message Passing Cellular Networks
  (EMPCNs), an extension of E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks to CW-complexes.
  Our approach addresses two aspects of geometric message passing networks: 1) enhancing
  their expressiveness by incorporating arbitrary cells, and 2) achieving this in
  a computationally efficient way with a decoupled EMPCNs technique. We demonstrate
  that EMPCNs achieve close to state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks without
  the need for steerability, including many-body predictions and motion capture. Moreover,
  ablation studies confirm that decoupled EMPCNs exhibit stronger generalization capabilities
  than their non-topologically informed counterparts. These findings show that EMPCNs
  can be used as a scalable and expressive framework for higher-order message passing
  in geometric and topological graphs'
