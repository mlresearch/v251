title: Preface to Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling
  (GRaM) Workshop
abstract: The Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling (GRaM)
  workshop at ICLR 2024 explored the concept of geometric grounding. A representation,
  method, or theory is grounded in geometry if it can be amenable to geometric reasoning,
  that is, it abides by the mathematics of geometry. This idea plays a crucial role
  in developing generative models that understand geometry and can aid in geometric
  representations. We explored many different aspects of geometric representations
  at the GRaM Workshop.
