title: Topology-Informed Graph Transformer
abstract: 'Transformers, through their self-attention mechanisms, have revolutionized
  performance in Natural Language Processing and Vision. Recently,there has been increasing
  interest in integrating Transformers with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
  analyzing geometric properties of graphs by employing global attention mechanisms.
  A key challenge in improving graph transformers is enhancing their ability to distinguish
  between isomorphic graphs, which can potentially boost their predictive performance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce ’Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT)’,
  a novel transformer enhancing both discriminative power in detecting graph isomorphisms
  and the overall performance of Graph Transformers. TIGT consists of four components:
  (1) a topological positional embedding layer using non-isomorphic universal covers
  based on cyclic subgraphs of graphs to ensure unique graph representation, (2) a
  dual-path message-passing layer to explicitly encode topological characteristics
  throughout the encoder layers, (3) a global attention mechanism, and (4) a graph
  information layer to recalibrate channel-wise graph features for improved feature
  representation. TIGT outperforms previous Graph Transformers in classifying synthetic
  dataset aimed at distinguishing isomorphism classes of graphs. Additionally, mathematical
  analysis and empirical evaluations highlight our model’s competitive edge over state-of-the-art
  Graph Transformers across various benchmark datasets.'
