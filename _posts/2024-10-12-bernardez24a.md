title: 'ICML Topological Deep Learning Challenge 2024: Beyond the Graph Domain'
abstract: This paper describes the 2nd edition of the ICML Topological Deep Learning
  Challenge that was hosted within the ICML 2024 ELLIS Workshop on Geometry-grounded
  Representation Learning and Generative Modeling (GRaM). The challenge focused on
  the problem of representing data in different discrete topological domains in order
  to bridge the gap between Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and other types of structured
  datasets (e.g. point clouds, graphs). Specifically, participants were asked to design
  and implement topological liftings, i.e. mappings between different data structures
  and topological domains –like hypergraphs, or simplicial/cell/combinatorial complexes.
  The challenge received 52 submissions satisfying all the requirements. This paper
  introduces the main scope of the challenge, and summarizes the main results and
  findings.
