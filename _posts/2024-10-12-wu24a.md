title: Graph Convolutional Networks for Learning Laplace-Beltrami Operators
abstract: Recovering a high-level representation of geometric data is a fundamental
  goal in geometric modeling and computer graphics. In this paper, we introduce a
  data-driven approach to computing the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
  of triangle meshes using graph convolutional networks. Specifically, we train graph
  convolutional networks on a large-scale dataset of synthetically generated triangle
  meshes, encoded with geometric data consisting of Voronoi areas, normalized edge
  lengths, and the Gauss map, to infer eigenvalues of 3D shapes. We attempt to address
  the ability of graph neural networks to capture global shape descriptors–including
  spectral information–that were previously inaccessible using existing methods from
  computer vision, and our paper exhibits promising signals suggesting that Laplace-Beltrami
  eigenvalues on discrete surfaces can be learned. Additionally, we perform ablation
  studies showing the addition of geometric data leads to improved accuracy.
