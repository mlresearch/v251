title: On Fairly Comparing Group Equivariant Networks
abstract: This paper investigates the flexibility of Group Equivariant Convolutional
  Neural Networks (G-CNNs), which specialize conventional neural networks by encoding
  equivariance to group transformations. Inspired by splines, we propose new metrics
  to assess the complexity of ReLU networks and use them to quantify and compare the
  flexibility of networks equivariant to different groups. Our analysis suggests that
  the current practice of comparing networks by fixing the number of trainable parameters
  unfairly affords models equivariant to larger groups additional expressivity. Instead,
  we advocate for comparisons based on a fixed computational budgetâ€”which we empirically
  show results in more similar levels of network flexibility. This approach allows
  one to better disentangle the impact of constraining networks to be equivariant
  from the increased expressivity they are typically granted in the literature, enabling
  one to obtain a more nuanced view of the impact of enforcing equivariance. Interestingly,
  our experiments indicate that enforcing equivariance results in <em>more</em> complex
  fitted functions even when controlling for compute, despite reducing network expressivity.
