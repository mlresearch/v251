title: Stability Analysis of Equivariant Convolutional Representations Through The
  Lens of Equivariant Multi-layered CKNs
abstract: In this paper we construct and theoretically analyse group equivariant convolutional
  kernel networks (CKNs) which are useful in understanding the geometry of (equivariant)
  CNNs through the lens of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). We then proceed
  to study the stability analysis of such equiv-CKNs under the action of diffeomorphism
  and draw a connection with equiv-CNNs, where the goal is to analyse the geometry
  of inductive biases of equiv-CNNs through the lens of reproducing kernel Hilbert
  spaces (RKHSs). Traditional deep learning architectures, including CNNs, trained
  with sophisticated optimization algorithms is vulnerable to perturbations, including
  ‘adversarial examples’. Understanding the RKHS norm of such models through CKNs
  is useful in designing the appropriate architecture and can be useful in designing
  robust equivariant representation learning models.
